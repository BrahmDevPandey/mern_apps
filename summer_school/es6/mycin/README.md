This a simple project in React to demonstrate some important concepts of React, like:
* Creating reusable components
* Using Bootstrap to style components
* Nesting of components
* Passing props to components
* State management of components
* Hooks in react
* Routing between different pages

This project helped me learn these concepts very efficiently.
